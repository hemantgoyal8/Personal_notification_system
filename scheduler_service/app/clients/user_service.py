# This file is created but left empty for now, as we're using mock_data.py
# Initially planned to use this, but decided to use mock users within the scheduler for simplicity to avoid modifying the User Service or handling auth tokens here.
# If User Service interaction is added later, implement client functions here using httpx.
# Example structure:
# import httpx
# from scheduler_service.app.core.config import settings
# import logging

# logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

# async def get_user_preferences(user_id: str) -> dict | None:
#     """Fetches user preferences from the User Service."""
#     # Note: This would require handling authentication if the User Service endpoint is protected
#     # Might need a service account token or similar mechanism
#     user_url = f"{settings.USER_SERVICE_BASE_URL}/users/{user_id}" # Assuming such an endpoint exists
#     async with httpx.AsyncClient() as client:
#         try:
#             response = await client.get(user_url)
#             response.raise_for_status() # Raise exception for 4xx/5xx status codes
#             user_data = response.json()
#             return user_data.get("preferences")
#         except httpx.RequestError as e:
#             logger.error(f"HTTP request error fetching user {user_id}: {e}")
#             return None
#         except httpx.HTTPStatusError as e:
#             logger.error(f"HTTP status error fetching user {user_id}: {e.response.status_code} - {e.response.text}")
#             return None
#         except Exception as e:
#              logger.error(f"Unexpected error fetching user {user_id}: {e}")
#              return None
